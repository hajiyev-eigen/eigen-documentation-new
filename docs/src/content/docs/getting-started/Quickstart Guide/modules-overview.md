# 2 Modules Overview

## 2.1 Datasources

The Datasources module shows all the data sources currently installed
along with a description and examples.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image49.png)

Each data source supports one or more types of display component, for
example, a Chart, Value, Table etc.

Clicking on the "Details" button to the right of any data source brings
out a slider with full details of the data available plus a button to
test it and see the response

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image50.png)

Clicking the "Test" button at the bottom right shows the direct response
from the data source on the left and the refined output provided to the
Ingenuity component on the right

![Screens screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image51.png)

These data sources appear under the Source dropdown for configurable
display elements (trend, KPI, sparkline, table etc.).

### 2.1.1 Types of datasource

There are four types of data source:

- **Value**: Supports the minimum requirements to display a single value
  (for a point in time) in a KPI

- **Multi Value**: Provides set of single value outputs at point in
  time, for display in a KPI. For example temperature, pressure &
  rainfall for a given location.

- **Table**: Provides a data set that can drive a table. i.e. fields
  that can be assigned to columns with a variable number of rows

- **Chart**: Provides a data set with time as the x axis and one or more
  series for the y-axes.

The following datasource types will be added [in the
future]{.underline}:

- **Map**: provide a dataset that will render a map

- **Geo**: provide a dataset that can be overlaid on a map

### 2.1.2 Categories of datasource

There are 4 categories of datasource:

- **Historian** data sources: full featured timeseries data source that
  supports interpolation. Only Historian sources can be used in
  Calculations. Historian data sources require an Eigen Historian driver
  (for example IP.21, Aveva PI, InfluxDB etc.)

- **Internal** data sources: these are data sources that connect to
  components within Ingenuity. They are used by the system but are also
  available to users, for example the Common Menu. Some of these data
  sources are "meta" data sources, in that they provide a list of
  available datasources.

- Data sources that require a **driver**: two-part data sources that
  require a driver installed against the source (for example SQL Server)
  plus a connector to that driver from the Ingenuity UI.

- **API** data sources: These can be configured directly in Ingenuity
  and connect to 3<sup>rd</sup> party APIs

## 2.2 Dashboards

The Dashboards module contains all the functionality for creating
beautiful displays. Clicking on the Dashboards module displays all the
dashboards in that Workspace.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image53.png)

Note that these dashboards will also be listed in the Page Tree. The
difference with this view is that there are Edit and Delete icons to
make managing the dashboards a bit quicker.

### 2.2.1 Standard vs Scaled dashboards

There are two types of dashboard that can be selected in the "Add"
content dropdown:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image38.png)

Standard dashboards have a grid and will scale the horizontal dimension
only. This means that the spacing between components will be reduced but
the text size will remain the same size.

Scaled dashboards will scale both the horizontal and the vertical
dimensions. This keeps the aspect ratio the same and is better for
keeping everything visible as the screen size changes.

The example below shows the effect of the two different settings on a
simple dashboard as the width of the screen is reduced

A simple dashboard with a Level and Dial:

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image54.png)

When the width of the window is reduced, the scaled dashboard keeps the
same aspect ratio:

Standard:

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically

Scaled:

:::tip

It is best to use the Scaled dashboard when overlaying data on a
background image*
:::

### 2.2.2 Adding Components

Components are added to a dashboard by dragging them in from the
left-hand panel. The following components are available:

|Component|Notes|Datasource|
|---|---|:-:|
|Text         |Simple text box for titles & labels|n/a|

## 2.3 Charts

The all-new Ingenuity Chart module is more powerful and more user
friendly than ever. A significant change from Ingenuity 6 is that there
is one unified chart component that covers all use cases from sparklines
to full page charts. The means that all the same charting options are
available for both sparklines and full charts.

### 2.3.1 Chart controls

The time range selection and controls for the component are all located
in the bar at the top.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image58.png)

### 2.3.2 Live mode & setting the time range

By default, new charts are in Live mode, which means that the right hand
side of the chart will be set to the current time and will update every
minute.

The time range of the chart can be change by users on the left hand side
of the top bar.

#### *Live mode*

In Live mode there is a dropdown with pre-configured intervals or a
custom interval can be typed, e.g. 3w = 3 weeks.

![A screen shot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image59.png)

The following are valid entries for time periods:

> s: seconds
>
> m: minutes
>
> h: hours
>
> d: days
>
> w: week
>
> y: year

The update frequency for Live mode is configurable in the Live mode
section of the chart configuration:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image60.png)

#### *Fixed mode*

When Live Mode is deactivated, the chart will not update automatically
and an exact start and end time can be selected using the time and date
pickers:

![A screenshot of a calendar Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image61.png)

### 2.3.3 Adding data

Data is added to a chart by either dragging and dropping it from the
basket, or clicking the Add tag button

Clicking the arrow on the right side of the Add tag button shows a list
of non-Historian data sources that support the Chart type.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image62.png)

### 2.3.4 Zooming in and the Lock function

By default the chart area is "unlocked". This means a user can click and
drag to select an area to zoom in on an area of interest.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image63.png)

Once zoomed in an undo button appears next to the "Add tag" button to
let the user quickly zoom back out.

![A screen shot of a computer screen Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image64.png)

It is possible to zoom in multiple times and the undo button will revert
the zooms one at a time.

When the cursor hovers over an axis, the pointer will change to a hand.
This shows that the axis can be:

- zoomed in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel; or

- shifted up or down (or left/right for the x-axis) by clicking and
  holding and then moving the mouse.

Sometimes this interactivity is not desirable and so it can be turned
off by clicking the lock icon to "Lock" the chart:

![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image65.png) 
🡪
![A black and white lock Description

### 2.3.5 Chart Settings Menu

The cog wheel icon on the right of the controls gives access to the
Settings menu:

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image67.png)

### 2.3.6 Chart pop-out

The magnifying glass will cause the chart to open in a full screen popup
window to make it easy to inspect the data in more detail.

![A black circle with a magnifying glass Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image68.png)

Changes in the pop-out chart will not affect the underlying component.

### 2.3.7 The Legend

Users can configure how a series is displayed in the legend at the
bottom of the chart.

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image69.png)

Everything from line style to chart style and axis can be configured
here.

### 2.3.8 Hiding and minifying the legend

The legend can be hidden or minfied via the settings menu, make the
chart cleaner better looking in reports and dashboards.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image70.png) ![A screenshot of a phone Description
automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image71.png)

*Selecting "Use mini legend" in the Settings menu shows a neat*

When the legend is in "mini" mode, it's position can be set in the
"Format component" section in the Configuration.

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image72.png)

### 2.3.9 Adding markers and comments

Pressing the space bar while the cursor is over the chart area will
place a marker where the cursor is.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image73.png)

Comments can be added to this marker by clicking the the triangle at the
top of the marker and then clicking "Edit".

![A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image74.png)

Comments are saved locally on within the page (so will be visible to
anyone else who views the page) but are not written back to the source
data.

### 2.3.10 Charts vs Sparklines

Although the component is the same behind the scenes, sparklines are
presented as different components when adding to a page because they
have a different set of default parameters (for example all the controls
and the legend are hidden):

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image75.png)

Charts can be converted to sparklines, and vice versa, in the Type
selection in the component configuration:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image76.png)

### 2.3.11 Seamless mode

Seamless mode hides the top bar with the controls to prevent users
changing the time range and to make the chart look clean and neat in
dashboards and reports:

![A white rectangular object with black letters and arrows Description

generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image77.png)

This is an example of a chart in seamless mode with a mini-legend.

![A graph of a graph Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image78.png)

To exit seamless mode, a button appears when the cursor is over the top
right corner of the chart.

## 2.4 Calculations & Synthetic timeseries

Synthetic timeseries are datasets that are either derived based on
existing data (for example taking an average), a generated set of points
based on a constant or function, or functions on dates. There are four
different souces of synthetic timeseries. These are listed below along
with their historian prefix:

1.  Calculations -- calc/

2.  Constant values -- value/

3.  Date values -- dates/

4.  Generated signals -- siggen/

### 2.4.1 Calculations

Calculations apply "in-line" transforms to any timeseries data source
connected to Ingenuity. There are 30 functions covering everything from
simple mathematical operators (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide etc.),
through to more complex Totalisers and statistical functions like
Average and Standard Deviation, logical If..Then functions and complex
transforms such as Timeshifting.

The Calculations module is not shown in the left-hand panel because it
behaves as a Historian datasource. It is accessible from any component
that can take a Historian datasource.

#### Available functions

The list of functions is shown below. See the dedicated chapter on
Calculations for full details.

|Add|Log|Sum|
|---|---|---|
|  Subtract            |    Power                 |  DIFF
|  Multiply            |    Average               |  Maximum
|  Divide              |    Count                 |  Minimum
|  Percent Deviation   |    Number of Bad Points  |  Mean
|  Totalise            |    Number of Good Points |  Median
|  Totalise Raw        |    Standard Deviation    |  Standard Deviation
|  Exponential         |    Variance              |  Variance
|  Natural Log         |    Minimum               |  If Tag Exists
|  Square Root         |    Maximum               |  If Equals
|  Stepped             |   Timeshift              |  Epoch_Ms
|  Stepped Raw         |    Point in Time         |


#### *Creating Calculations (accessing the Editor)*

The Calculation graphical editor is on the "Calculation" tab in the
"Edit tag" form.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image80.png)

This form appears when the "Add tag" button is clicked on a trend:

![A blue and white rectangular box with white text Description
automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image81.png)

Or when the magnifying glass icon is clicked on the right hand side of
the tag datasource entry field when editing a tag on a trend or
dashboard:

![A screenshot of a social media account Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image82.png)

#### *Editing the Calculation Equations*

Ingenuity 7's virtual calculation graphical editor is an easy-to-use
drag-and-drop user interface in which any Ingenuity user can quickly
configure complex calculations while minimizing human error.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image83.png)

Function blocks are dragged and dropped into a canvas, after which,
inputs and outputs can be connected to compose any complex
transformation.

Calculations can be linked together to form complex expressions multiple
layers deep, and the performance remains fast.

### 2.4.2 Constant values -- value/

The "value" historian returns a trendable timeseries for constant
values. This is useful for displaying reference values on a chart or
KPI.

For example, to display a line at 90 on a chart, the following series
can be plotted:
```
value/90
```
### 2.4.3 Date values -- dates/

The "date" historian returns date information about values or relative
times. The functions available are:

- IS_TODAY - Return 1 if given timestamp is today

- IS_BEFORE_TODAY - Return 1 if given timestamp is before midnight of
  today

- DAYS_IN_MONTH - Return number of days in month

- CURRENT_EPOCH_MS - Return wall clock time in epoch ms

All time values are in epoch milliseconds, which

### 2.4.4 Signal Generator -- siggen/ 

The Signal Generator historian generates synthetic timeseries of known
wave forms such as Sine & Cosine, or repeatable random numbers. The
syntax is

Syntax is (without the spaces):
```
\[function\]\[amplitude\]\[+/- y-offset\]@\[period\]\[+/- x-offset\]
```
The x-offset is in seconds from GMT and [does not]{.underline} account
for daylight savings adjustments.

For example, a sinewave of amplitudes -10 and 10; offset by -30 (i.e.
between -40 and -20), with a period of 600 seconds; offset by -3600
seconds (1 hr) from GMT
```
sin10-30@600-3600
```
The wave forms available are:

- sin (sine)

- cos (cosine)

- saw (saw wave)

- sq (square wave)

- sc (S-curve)

- rand (repeatable random number)

## 2.5 Reports

The Reports module is the solution to automating the creation and
distribution of regular reports. It lets users turn any dashboard into
an issued report. It also enables auto-creation of the report on
schedule.

### 2.5.1 Creating and scheduling reports

The example below shows a report scheduled to run on Monday's at 08:00.
It is based on a dashboard and some of the content is marked as hidden
so that it will not be included in the issued report.

![Screens screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image84.png)

### 2.5.2 Viewing issued reports

When a report is issued the data is snapshotted into the report and is
no longer live. This means that the report will always show the data at
the time it was issued and cannot be changed (without leaving an audit
trail). The history of issued reports is easily accessible.

![A screenshot of a report Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image85.png)

## 2.6 Scripts

Scripts are essential for automating workflows and making more advanced
functionality. The Scripts module in Ingenuity is NodeRed<sup>TM</sup>; a
flow-based, low-code development tool for visual programming .

NodeRed<sup>TM</sup> is the next evolution of Excel for engineers.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image86.png)

Scripts can be created to do all kinds of tasks from importing data,
checking data, combining data, performing actions and exposing new APIs.

NodeRed<sup>TM</sup> is a Node.js based application and the functions are written in
JavaScript, which is very easy to learn.

Examples of workflows that can be created quickly are:

- Check if data has changed and run some logic

- Run every 5 minutes to calculate the amount of fluid that has been
  removed from a tank

- Read data from one system, cleanse and process it and write an output
  to another system

## 2.7 Knowledge Graph

Hosted in Neo4j, the Knowledge Graph is a digital map of information and
how it is related (sometimes called Contextualisation).

It is a semantic graph and can be used to model anything, for example
facilities, regions, systems, equipment, roles, maintenance,
manufacturers, suppliers, spares catalogues etc.

Semantic means that it addes meaning to information.

It can include non-physical objects like systems, areas, barrier
hierarchy, maintenance plans, FEMA failure modes.

It can hold links to information in other systems such as sensor data,
documents, drawings, certificates, procedures and there is the
possibility to include dynamic information such as work orders.

![A diagram of a system Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image87.png)
<p>An example of part of a Knowledge Graph showing the
information related to a Pressure Safety Transmitter</p>


The Knowledge Graph can also hold data structures that can be used to
create model-driven visualisation.

The Knowledge Graph entry in the left-hand panel will give access to the
Neo4j browser where the Knowledge Graph can be queried directly using
Cypher.

Information on using Cypher is available at
<https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/>

Information in the Knowledge Graph is used in the Search results
[(section 1.12)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#112-search) Common Menu [(1.12.1)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#1121-the-common-menu) , Asset Model [(2.8)](#28-asset-model) and Asset dashboard component [(2.2.2)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/modules-overview/#22-dashboards).

## 2.8 Asset Model

The Asset Model tool is a simple browser for the Knowledge Graph that
lets the user navigate as if it was a hierarchy.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image88.png)

The properties for the object selected are shown in the right hand
panel.

Where linked information is connected, such as Timeseries data, it is
shown at the top of the right-hand panel.

## 2.9 Alerts

Users can configure checks against changes in information and receive an
email or text message when the check is triggered (i.e. when it returns
a True status).

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image89.png)

The Alerts configuration is very similar to the Calculations UI and is
accessed from the Alerts entry in the left-hand panel.

## 2.10 Data Pipelines

Data pipelines are used where either;

- Further processing is required on an existing datasource before it can
  be used; or

- Data from more than one source needs to be combined to create a new
  dataset

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image90.png)

## 2.11 Documents Portal

The Documents Portal makes it easy to consolidate all the different
kinds of documents and reports that generated internally or received
from 3rd parties. It automatically detects metadata such as report type
and equipment and saves this in a database.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image91.png)

Users can easily search for reports by equipment type, date, company,
area, system, location etc. All documents have a URL so can be linked to
the associated work-order or scheduled inspection

## 2.12 Apps

Ingenuity 7 has a new extensible architecture that supports plug-ins.

A plug-in application makes it easy to extend the functionality of
Ingenuity while keeping the same authentication, look and feel and
access to data sources.

Eigen offer a continually expanding library of plug-in apps, and 3<sup>rd</sup>
parties can also develop apps. For example, the Logbook plug-in can be
used to create log books, for example for Shiftlogs, Valve registers,
actions etc.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image92.png)

## 2.13 Wiki

The Wiki module makes it easy to create online documentation. It has a
simplified page layout that makes it easy to create clean looking
documentation.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image93.png)

## 2.14 Subscription

The Subscriptions module is only visible to Admins and is used for
setting the defaults within the subscription, for example Timezone. It
is also possible to change the logo and download usage metrics.
