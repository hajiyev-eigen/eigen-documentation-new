# 1 An Introduction to Ingenuity 7

Ingenuity is Eigen's digital platform for Engineering and Industrial
Operations. It is built by Engineers, for Engineering and Asset Managers
to make working with data a joy. The Ingenuity platform was first
written in 2009 and now, 15 years on, Ingenuity 7 is a major new
release; a complete re-write from the ground up to include the latest
and best technology and incorporate all the learnings we have from over
17 years deploying digital capability for Oil & Gas, Energy, Chemicals
and Manufacturing industries. It's faster, more secure and more
intuitive than ever before.

There is a publicly accessible demo of Ingenuity 7 available at
<https://ingenuity-sandbox.eigen.co/>.

## 1.1 What is Ingenuity

Eigen Ingenuity is a digital platform for getting value from data,
improving decision making and automating labour intensive work
processes.

It is a layer on top of existing systems and makes it easy way to
combine, visualise, publicise and share information from existing
systems through online charts, dashboards, reports and automate
workflows.

There is no requirement to copy data to a data lake or replace the
underlying systems. It is also agnostic, so it is easy to roll out
capability across sites with different systems.

## 1.2 System Licensing

Ingenuity is a cloud-native application and supports multi-tenancy.

*Cloud-native* means that it is "containerised" to run in a virtual
environment (Kubernetes) and is not installed directly onto hardware. It
does not mean that it has to be installed in the cloud - **it can be
installed on-premise on local virtual machines (VM's) or in a cloud
environment such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS**.

*Multi-tenancy* means that a single install can support multiple
concurrent subscriptions. A "Subscription" is a digitally segregated set
of users, content, datasources and modules.

Ingenuity is licenced "per subscription" and any module licencing
applies to that subscription only.

In most on-premise installations there will only be 1 subscription, but
the possibility exists to create multiple subscriptions if necessary,
for example where a company has business units (in different countries)
that must be segregated financially.

Aspects of a Subscription are managed under the Subscriptions module:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image3.png)
<p>The configuration of a Subscription is managed through
the Subscription Module</p>


## 1.3 Modules

Ingenuity is now divided into modules to make it easier to navigate and
so that individual modules can be licensed separately.

The installed modules are visible on the left had side of the screen:

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image4.png)

A summary of the available modules is presented in the table below.

The list of available modules, and if they are a separately licensed
from the base install:

|**Module**|**Details**|**Separate license**|
|---|---|:-:|
|Datasources  |Easy overview of all connected datasources|\-|

|Wiki         |Create documentation for easy access within your organisation|Yes|
|Subscription |Admin access to manage your subscription |\-|

## 1.4 Logging in

There are two ways to configure the authentication in Ingenuity. This
configuration must be done by Eigen during the system setup.:

1.  "Single Sign On" - Connecting it to Microsoft Azure (most common);
    or

2.  Local accounts using email & password -- good for installations not
    connected to Microsoft

#### *Logging in with Azure*

Where an instance is configured to use Azure, users will see this screen
on first accessing the system.


![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image5.png)
<p>When configured to use the Microsoft Azure
Authentication, users will be presented with a “Sign in with Azure”
button.</p>

Users must click "Sign in with Azure" and will then be taken through the
standard Microsoft authentication process, which will include 2-Factor
authentication (such as via Authenticator) if they have set this up.

#### *Logging in with a local account*

Where local Ingenuity accounts are used, users will be presented with
fields to enter their email address and password, as well as a link to
reset their password if they have forgotten it.


![A screenshot of a login form Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image6.png)
<p>Where local accounts are enabled, users must enter their
email address and password.</p>


## 1.5 User Permissions

There are three basic levels of access available:

1.  Admin -- can manage users and access

2.  User -- can view and create content

3.  Anonymous

Admins and Users can be added to Groups to make it easy to configure
access to Workspaces and other content:

![A screenshot of a group Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image7.png)

Within a Subscription, user access can be restricted to Workspaces and
down to a Page level.

### 1.5.1 User Management

Users are per-subscription and are managed under the Subscriptions
module [(Section 2.12)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/modules-overview/#214-subscription).

## 1.6 Navigation

The first page a user will see when they log in is the landing page (for
the Subscription they have logged in to if in multi-tenancy mode):

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image8.png)

This page gives quick access to recent pages, training courses and four
panels with current news or events of interest to users in that
Subscription. The content of these four panels is specific to a
Subscription and is managed by System Administrators in the Ingenuity
Hub [(see section 3.2)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/admin/).

### 1.6.1 Screen areas

To make it more intuitive, the screen is now divided into different
areas, so that users always know where to look to find the function they
need.

Components along the top are always visible unless in Kiosk mode.

#### *Top right*

Clicking the site logo will take a user back to the site home page.

![A black and orange logo Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image9.png)

Clicking the hamburger button on the left shows the Quicklinks menu.

This is a user configurable, user specific, menu of shortcuts to
Ingenuity content or other URLs:

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image10.png)

Clicking "Edit" lets a user add and manage their Quicklinks.

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image11.png)

Administrators can set site (Subscription) wide Quicklinks in the
Ingenuity Hub

The \[\<\] arrow to the right of the site logo will collapse the side
bar so that only the icons are visible.

![A close up of a logo Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image12.png)

#### *Top middle*

The Search bar lets users quickly search for data, content or objects in
the Knowledge Graph.

![A close-up of a text Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image13.png)

The Trend button instantly brings up a blank trend

![A close up of a text Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image14.png)

When the user is on a page that they have edit permissions for, three
additional buttons will be visible to Add content, manage content, and
manage permissions:

![A black arrow and a black dot Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image15.png)

The Manage Content is behind a button with three dots \[...\] to signal
that there are more options here. The available options depends on the
content of the current page and the user permissions:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image16.png)

#### *Top Right*

The Basket is a way to collect references to data and information that
you would like to refer back to.

![A blue square with white shopping basket Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image17.png)

#### *Left hand panel*

The left hand panel is the main way to navigate within the system. At
the top is the Workspace selector [(see 1.6.2)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#162-workspaces), access to the Page Tree
[(see 1.6.3)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#163-the-page-tree) and the Modules [(see section 2)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/modules-overview/).


![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image4.png)
<p>The left hand panel is the main way to navigate around the system</p>

#### Bottom Left corner

The bottom left corner shows the logged in user and a link to the Help
and Support page.

![A screenshot of a chat Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image18.png)

Clicking on "Help and Support" brings up a page with a link to the Eigen
support desk, as well as details of the system that may be needed in the
case of contacting support, such as the instance name, licence etc.

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image19.png)

Clicking on the logged in user brings up a menu of available
user-specific settings:

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image20.png)

This includes being able to select the Theme [(see 1.7)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#17-themes-and-modes), edit user
settings and Log Out.

Superusers will have access to Ingenuity Hub

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image21.png)

#### *Right hand panel*

The right hand panel is only visible when a page is in Edit mode. The
content of this panel changes dynamically to show all the available
configuration options

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image22.png) ![A screenshot of a computer Description
automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image23.png)

Different examples of configuration options\
in the right hand panel

#### *Bottom right hand corner*

There is normally nothing in the bottom right corner unless the current
page is in Kiosk mode [(see 1.10)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/getting-started/quickstart-guide/introduction/#110-displaying-content--kiosk-mode). In this case there is a barely visible
button to exit Kiosk mode that only appears clickable when the mouse
cursor is over it:

![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image25.png)
🡪
![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image24.png)

### 1.6.2 Workspaces

All content in Ingenuity is arranged in "Workspaces". Each user has
their own personal Workspace, plus shared Workspaces can be created. The
Workspaces are accessed from the dropdown in the top right. A user can
only access the Workspaces for which they have View or Edit permissions.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image26.png)

### 1.6.3 The Page Tree

A Workspace is analogous to a top-level folder. The content within a
Workspace is organized in a hierarchy called the Page Tree. On entering
a Workspace, the user sees the Page Tree for that Workspace.

If a user has Admin rights to a Workspace, there is an edit icon visible
to the right of the "Page Tree" heading. (See Manual Section 14 --
Workspaces and Pages).

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image27.png)

If a user has Admin rights to a Workspace, there is an edit icon visible
to the right of the "Page Tree" heading. (See Manual Section 4 --
Workspaces and Pages).

## 1.7 Themes and Modes

Ingenuity supports multiple Themes. A Theme defines how everything
appears on the screen, including the colours, fonts and logos. Each
Theme has a Light mode &, a Dark mode and Normal & Small modes.

Themes are installed by Eigen but users can select the mode they would
like to use by clicking on their user name in the bottom left corner.

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image20.png)

### 1.7.1 Light and Dark Modes

The system comes with default a default Eigen Theme in Light and Dark
Mode Themes. The examples below show the same page in Light and Dark
modes.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image29.png)

### 1.7.2 Small and normal modes

The "Small" mode for a theme is useful where screen space is limited
because the side bar and headings take up less room

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image30.png)


![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image31.png)
<p>The lower screenshot shows Small mode makes left panel and the headings take up less room.</p>

## 1.8 Trending data

### 1.8.1 Quick access to trend data

Trending data is essential for engineering and production operations.
Very often there is a need to quickly check something and pull up a
trend. Ingenuity 7 makes trending data even quicker and easier than
before, with a new "Trend" button that is always visible at the top
right of the screen, as well as the proven features like fast search,
the Basket and drag and drop.

![A close up of a text Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image14.png)

Clicking the new Trend button brings up a blank pop-up trend.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image32.png)

Data can be added to the trend in one of three ways:

- Searching for a tag by clicking the \[Add tag\] button ![A blue
  rectangle with white text Description automatically
  generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image33.png)

- Selecting a datasource that provides trendable data from the ![A blue
  rectangle with white text Description automatically
  generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image34.png) icon to the right of the Add tag button

- Dragging and dropping a tag from the Basket..

Other ways to bring up a trend are:

- Clicking on a value in a dashboard

- Clicking the "trend" icon by an item in the Basket (see [section 1.9](#19-creating-content)).

### 1.8.2 The new Chart component

The all new Chart component in Ingenuity 7 is more intuitive than ever.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image35.png)

The following chart types are available:

![A screenshot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image36.png)

See [section 2.3](#23-charts) below for more details, and [(Product Manual - Charts)](https://docs.eigeningenuity.co/modules/charts/overview/).

## 1.9 Creating Content

Everyone likes good looking visuals, especially everyone at Eigen, and
Ingenuity 7 makes it even easier to make beautiful dashboards. It also
makes it even easier to display these dashboards on public displays with
the new Kiosk mode.

### 1.9.1 Adding a Page, Chart or Dashboard

When a user is in a Workspace for which they have edit permission, the
![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image37.png) button is visible in the top right. There
are 4 different types of content that can be added:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image38.png)

All options look similar, but they have some subtle differences. The
most significant difference is the Dashboard (scaled), which does not
have a visible layout grid.

- **Page**: A blank web page with a layout grid to make it easy to align
  content. Users can add any content from the palette

- **Chart**: A Chart is a Page that is tagged as a Chart (so that it
  appears in the Charts module) and has a full width chart component
  added by default. Users can add additional charts and other components
  in Edit mode.

- **Dashboard**: A Dashboard is a blank page that is tagged as a
  Dashboard so that it appears in the Dashboards module.

- **Dashboard (scaled)**: this is a Dashboard that *does not have a
  visible layout grid* so that components can be freely placed anywhere.
  This is especially useful for creating dashboards with a background
  image where pixel level placement accuracy is required.

### 1.9.2 Edit mode

In order to edit a page it must first be put in Edit mode. This is done
by sliding the toggle switch in the top right hand corner
![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image39.png).

When the page is in edit mode, the component pallet is visble on the
right, and the layout grid is visible in the page body. Components are
added by dragging them from the palette and resizing them as desired.
The grid will automatically extend downwards as components are added.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image40.png)

The panel on the right shows the configuration options for the currently
selected component (or the grid itself).

### 1.9.3 Component Templates

Many of the available components have a library of pre-configured
templates. These are accessed by clicking on the three dots in the
bottom right hand corned of the component box:

![A screen shot of a phone Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image41.png)

This will bring up a popup of the available templates.

![A screenshot of a graph Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image42.png)

Click and hold on the \[Drag to grid\] button on the one you would like
to use and you will be able to place it on the page grid.

### 1.9.4 Saving or reverting changes

As soon as the content on a page is changed, Save or Revert buttons
appear at the top:

![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image43.png)

It is possible to go in and out of Edit mode without losing changes, but
changes must be saved before navigating away from the page, otherwise
all changes will be lost.

## 1.10 Displaying content -- Kiosk Mode

Kiosk Mode is used for displaying Dashboards on public displays. I
removes all the application navigation and headers so that the content
can take up the whole screen.

Normal view: Kiosk mode:

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image44.png) ![A screenshot of a computer Description
automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image45.png)

To exit Kiosk mode, there is a subtle button at the bottom right of the
screen that only appears clickable when the mouse cursor is over it:

![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image25.png)
🡪
![](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image24.png)

## 1.11 Collecting Data - The Basket

The Basket is a way to collect references to data and information that
you would like to refer back to.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image46.png)

Much like the shopping basket on a website, a used can add things to
their basket and come back to them later.

The Save and Load functions provide a handy way to create personal lists
of useful information that is regularly accessed.

## 1.12 Search

The Search bar lets users quickly search for data, content or objects in
the Knowledge Graph.

![A close-up of a text Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image13.png)

The search results will appear in a slide-out on the right hand side of
the page.

![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically
generated](~/assets/quick-start-guide/image47.png)

Search results are interactive and will take the user to the live
instance of the result.

### 1.12.1 The Common Menu

Clicking on a result in the Assets section will bring up the Common
Menu. This shows all the related information in the Knowledge Graph and
includes live links to referenced information such as drawings,
timeseries data and other assets.
