# 4 Working with Calculations

This chapter covers detailed aspects of working with calculations to
make more intuitive and user friendly content.

## 4.1 SLIDINGAGG vs WINDOWAGG

Both SLIDINGAGG and WINDOWAGG are types of aggregate calculations that
can be performed on time series data and are used to compute aggregate
functions like min, max, average, etc. There are important differences
between them though, and these are described below.

:::tip

SLIDINGAGG provides a moving aggregation based on a time window over
interpolated points, suitable for real-time trends, while WINDOWAGG
provides aggregations over fixed time windows, retrieved directly from
the historian, and is generally more appropriate for retrospective
analysis.

:::

### 4.1.1 Differences

#### *Data Source for Calculation:*

SLIDINGAGG calculations are performed over **interpolated points**
retrieved from the historian . The system retrieves a range of points
and then calculates the aggregate over a sliding window.

WINDOWAGG calculations, in contrast, **request the aggregated data
directly from the historian** . If the underlying historian does not
support direct aggregate retrieval for the specified window, the Eigen
historian driver will simulate it by fetching raw data and performing
the aggregation .

#### *Window Behavior:*

**SLIDINGAGG operates with windows that slide over time**1 \.... For
each point in time, the aggregate is calculated based on the data within
the preceding (or centered) time window that moves with the current
time.

**WINDOWAGG uses fixed windows that are aligned to specific time
boundaries, anchored to the nearest midnight UTC**. The aggregate is
calculated for these discrete, non-overlapping time intervals .

#### *Real-time vs. Retrospective Analysis:*

SLIDINGAGG provides a consistent view of the aggregated data in both
real-time and when looking back at historical data because the
calculation is always based on a defined sliding window of past data.

**WINDOWAGG can exhibit different behavior in real-time for the current,
incomplete, window compared to its retrospective view once the window
has fully elapsed**. Until the end of the window, the aggregate value
(like maximum for a totalizer) will not reflect the full range of data
within that window. Therefore, **WINDOWAGG is considered more of a
retrospective function**12 .

#### *Performance:*

WINDOWAGG is generally **more performant than SLIDINGAGG** when the
historian natively supports aggregate queries, as it reduces the amount
of data that needs to be transferred and computed.

#### *Handling of Peaks:*

In SLIDINGAGG, a peak value within the sliding window will influence the
aggregate output for the entire duration the peak remains within that
window (i.e. from the timestamp of the peak to the timestamp + window).

In WINDOWAGG, a transient peak occurring late in a window might only
affect the aggregate calculation for that window briefly in real-time.
However, when viewed retrospectively, that peak will be reflected in the
aggregate for the entire window. For example, a peak occurring in the
59th minute of a 1 hour window for a MAX calculation will affect the
current value for 1 minute but then the whole prior window will take on
that value as soon as the window period rolls over to a new one.

#### *Use Cases:*

SLIDINGAGG is suitable for applications where a continuously updating
aggregate value based on a recent time window is required, such as
dashboards showing real-time trends.

WINDOWAGG is well-suited for analyzing data over completed, fixed time
intervals, like calculating daily, monthly, or yearly averages, or for
visualizing the range (min/max) of values within those fixed periods.

## 4.2 Calculation example: Totalise for quarterly rates.

In this calculation example we will cover a very popular function from
our calculation engine which is Totalise points. For calculating daily
rates from a tag with hourly rates, for example, m3/h of production, we
have to use the Totalise points function. Drag this function into the
grid from the menu in the "Calculation" tab when adding a tag, you will
find it under the "Totalisers" tab.

The input to this function will look as follows.

Under "Tag to Totalise" you will add the tag or calculation you wish to
totalise. You can click on the magnifying glass to search for a tag if
necessary. The tag should have the name of the historian followed by a
"/" before the name of the tag, if you search for it with the magnifying
glass there is no need for this. Take note of the units of the tag since
we will need this information later.

The "Window size" refers to the time span that you wish to totalise your
tag to, for example, we have our production tag in m3/h and we wish to
know how much we produce per quarter, then the "Window size" should be
"Quarter". Click on it to open the drop-down menu and select the desired
option.

For "Window Offset or Anchor" we will select "BEGIN_QUARTER", this means
that it will start from 0 each quarter (1<sup>st</sup> January, 1<sup>st</sup> April,
1<sup>st</sup> July and 1<sup>st</sup> October). And lastly, we will add the "Data Rate"
from our tag, since this example has a tag with m3/h, the data rate will
be "1h" for 1 hour. For 1 second the value would be "1s", for daily
rates it would be "1d", etc. Here is the input from our example and how
it looks on a chart.
